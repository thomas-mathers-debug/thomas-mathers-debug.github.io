            Emotional intelligence otherwise known as EQ is the capability to recognize ones own emotions and pick up on those of others. This emotional information should help guide thinking and behaviour while making you more adaptable to others.

Benefits of increasing your EQ include better performance, leadership qualities and higher happiness.
In comparasion to IQ, EQ is a better indicator of success in the workplace and is used to identify leaders, good team players, and people who best work by themselves.
While IQ is used to determine academic abilities and identify individuals with off-the-chart intelligence or mental challenges.
