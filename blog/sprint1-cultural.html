    <p>I tend to value compassion and honesty a lot as my personal values, I usually put other people before myself and find that when people around me are happy so am I. I’m quite emotionally driven which helps me relate to how others are feeling but also gets me stressed quite easily. A recent ethical situation I was put in was a friend of mine was having trouble in a relationship, giving him the cold truth about his situation and how it was affecting his life and the people around him was difficult but I knew he needed to hear it from someone. In the end one of the big reasons they broke up was because of that talk.
    </p>

    <p>Culture may also have an affect on my personality, I’ve done a lot of traveling and lived in many places with international environments, this has probably shaped what a value.
    </p>

    <p>By taking the Myers Briggs personality test I learnt that my personality matches an adventures personality which suggests I have strengths in being sensitive, passionate and imaginative, but also downfalls of too much independence and easily stressed. This shows that my strengths match my personal values.
    </p>
    <p>
        I would say being imaginative and passionate will help my studies and allow me to push myself to achieve the goals I want.
    </p>
    <p>
        In group environments where there is tension or resistance the best approach is to be open minded and have a good plan. Try to include everyone in the group and never disregard any ideas, by strategizing a plan and dividing the work fairly, a group can easily work together. I also find having someone take charge makes things go a lot smoother, the only issue is that I have noticed some people compete for this role.
