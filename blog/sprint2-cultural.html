            <li>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</li>
            <p>My long term goal is to build technical skills and experience so I can get a junior development position.
            </p>
            <li>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li>
            <p>Probably confidence in putting my self out there more, eg. confidently meeting new people.
                </p>
            <li>A description of your own strengths and limitations</li>
            <p>I think my strengths include hardworking, getting along easily with people and being creative. My big limitation is burning my self out with constant work and stress.
                </p>
            <li>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</li>
            <p>I think just using a time based system and sticking with it helps a lot, I tend to get side tracked and focus on smaller less important things.
                </p>
            <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</li>
            <p>Slack seems like a good tool to seek help I can just ask my facilitator for assistance.
                </p>
            <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
            <p>Just that they can be responsive to questions.
                </p>
    </ul>
