    <ul>
            <li>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</li>
            <p>My long term goal is to build technical skills and experience so I can get a junior development position.
            </p>
            <li>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li>
            <p>Probably confidence in putting my self out there more, eg. confidently meeting new people.
                </p>
            <li>A description of your own strengths and limitations</li>
            <p>I think my strengths include hardworking, getting along easily with people and being creative. My big limitation is burning my self out with constant work and stress.
                </p>
            <li>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</li>
            <p>I think just using a time based system and sticking with it helps a lot, I tend to get side tracked and focus on smaller less important things.
                </p>
            <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</li>
            <p>Slack seems like a good tool to seek help I can just ask my facilitator for assistance.
                </p>
            <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
            <p>Just that they can be responsive to questions.
                </p>
    </ul>

      <h3>Updated Learning plan</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</li>
        <p>I still really want to go into some kind of technical development job, no particular position but maybe something like app or web development.
        </p>
        <li>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</li>
        <p>My strenth will probably be my computer science background and my weakness will probably be putting my selfout there when it comes to the other people. 
            </p>
        <li>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</li>
        <p>I'm quite a reserved person and don't like to share personal things especially within a big group, I always feel like I need to get more involved and put myself out there.
            </p>
        <li>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</li>
        <p>Definitly like sharing with groups, I'm fine when its 1 or 2 people but a large group I tend to shy away from.
            </p>
        <li>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
        <p>Just understand that it takes me a while to get into some things
            </p>
        <li>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</li>
        <p>To work hard and really make the most of it
            </p>
