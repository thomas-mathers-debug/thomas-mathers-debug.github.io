    <h4>This week I got blocked by the use of arrows (=>) in functions. To solve this problem I used a mixture of google
      and console.logging. Googling lead me to useful information such as example code and youtube videos while
      console.logging let me test what I was doing and answering my questions. This is my go to problem solving method
      when it comes to codding and I think its one of the best, asking coach and peers is something that I would do as a
      final option.</h4>
